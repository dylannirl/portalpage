        <h2 id="panel-1-title">Me as a Client</h2>
        <p>
          I decide the content and images to use for my site by brainstorming and figuring out what I thought would match my own asthetic.
          I communicated with my developer through canvas and email. We struggled in communicating and I never recieved a link to my site.
          I have no idea as I cannot access it.
          Make sure communication is there.

      <section class="panel" aria-labelledby="panel-2-title">
        <h2 id="panel-2-title">Lead Developer</h2>
        <p>
          I managed my team by keeping communication going and aligning our efforts together as a whole.
          I didn't have to communicate too much with the client as the product outlined was very thorough and understandable.
          I handled my clients site with the upmost care and reached out to him to make sure he had access to it.
          Github was easy to use and helped streamline the project.

      <section class="panel" aria-labelledby="panel-3-title">
        <h2 id="panel-3-title">Jr. Developer</h2>
        <p>
          I communicated with my leads mainly over canvas. I had no issue.
          I did know what was expected as the wireframes were pretty transparent.
          I was able to contribute my making one page for each site.
          No issues with Github

      <section class="panel" aria-labelledby="panel-4-title">
        <h2 id="panel-4-title">General Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          The most challegning part was definitly the communication and being able to align ideas with everybody on the team.
          The part I enjoyed most was being able to create with skills that we learned.
          Something I would do differently if I could do this project again is make sure to get phone numbers of my clients, developers, etc to allow for better communication.
          I do feel confident in working on real world projects because I now know the skills, other than just html and css, that it takes to actually develop for a project. Communication and design are important and I learned that here.
